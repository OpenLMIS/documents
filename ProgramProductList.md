### Notes

CommTrack will use this data managing the reporting process with Clinicians / CHWs, and submitting Reports to OpenLMIS

Issue:  OpenLMIS categorizes Products on both a Program basis and a Facility-Type basis.  This distinction needs to be supported within CommTrack, since CommTrack will support CHWs/facilities of multiple types.
